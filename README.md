Sketch: 

I made a sketch on p5.js using variables and conditionals on falling squares that would change colour when the mouse is moved half way across the vertical screen. A problem I encountered with this sketch was using noStroke to get rid of the outline, however since I didn't figure out how to do that I just made the squares black. Also the squares seemed slightly different heights which I couldn't figure out why.

Shapes: 

I experimented with 2 shapes from the p5.js documentation, mostly with the colour, size, and shapes with these shapes, which helped me understand the p5.js functions better.
