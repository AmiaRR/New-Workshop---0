In workshop 0 I made a P5JS sketch using squares, variables, and conditionals to make a row of falling squares that would return to the top of the canvas. I also used MouseX so the squares would change from pink to black when I moved the cursor to the right side of the canvas.

I also experimented with a few shapes from the P5JS documentation, mostly with the colour, size, and number of sides.
